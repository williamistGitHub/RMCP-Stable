# RMCP-Stable

RMCP-Stable is a fork/continuation of [RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) v1.0-pre3 that adds
features without giving up stability & compatibility.

Please report bugs if you find them, and submit feature requests for consideration on the [issues tab](https://github.com/williamistGitHub/RMCP-Stable/issues).

If you'd like to fix a bug or add a feature, make sure it first has an issue and has been proven to be a bug or is an
accepted feature request. Once that is all set, fork the repository, make your changes (separate branch recommended) and
make a [pull request](https://github.com/williamistGitHub/RMCP-Stable/pulls) with your changes.
